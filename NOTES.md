# Notes

Here are some things I'm using for reference and information to guide my development. 

## "Whole Web App" resources
Looking for some things for "how do I connect my front end and back end?"

Options:
* Servlets
* JSPs
* HttpServer (Apache, Tomcat, Nginx, etc...)
* Spring Web or MVC
* Hibernate
* JPA framework

Specific known examples from my past with Intuit/Itrios involve the servlet/jsp handling. (Apache Tomcat, switched to Nginx and )

Known example from AppBind and similar places is api backend running with node js,
frontend with react on nodejs, and some tooling to load with that; node including the http or request dependency
