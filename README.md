# simplestFrontToBack
Creating a shell of an application, which includes a database connection, object structures, some API, and some front-end structure.

This is going to take a while, since I need to brainstorm what to do with it and also decide what technologies to use for practice.

!! I had abandoned this at the same time I found a contract job. Still a valid task to learn.
